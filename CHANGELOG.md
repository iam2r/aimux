# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 0.1.22 (2026-08-31)

### Features

- Cloud sync gains a GitHub Gist backend: `apmux sync gist setup <token>` creates — or finds, by the sync-format marker in the gist description — a secret gist holding the same `store.json` + `manifest.json` pair the WebDAV backend uses, seeded with the current local store. `sync gist push|pull|status` share WebDAV's conflict detection, manifest verification, local backups and re-apply logic, and `setup --gist <id-or-url>` pins an existing gist.

## 0.1.21 (2026-08-31)

### Fixes

- Self-update and the installers now take a bare version like `v0.1.20` (or `0.1.20`); the internal `apmux/` tag prefix is applied when querying GitHub. A version that no longer exists (e.g. a pre-rename `v0.1.18`, or `aimux/vX.Y.Z` passed to install.sh/install.ps1) no longer errors: both the CLI and the install scripts print a note and fall back to the latest release instead, so any well-formed version spec installs something. `update --check --json` reports the new `targetVersion` field (user-facing `vX.Y.Z`).
- Drop all aimux migration/compatibility code: the one-time `~/.aimux` → `~/.apmux` config-dir migration, the `aimux-sync` → `apmux-sync` WebDAV namespace migration, `AIMUX_*` env-var fallbacks, and the `aimux-*` release-asset aliases are all removed. Existing users have already migrated; pre-rename data is only mentioned in the CHANGELOG now. CI's PR policy gate no longer blocks the test jobs — fmt/clippy/tests always run on every PR regardless of the gate outcome.

## 0.1.20 (2026-08-31)

### Fixes

#### fix(legacy): merge missing files from the old `~/.aimux` config dir into `~/.apmux` when both exist

The previous migration only renamed `~/.aimux` to `~/.apmux` when the new
directory was missing. If anything had already created `~/.apmux` first
(for example the new binary's first `apmux status` call creates the
empty dir before `webdav.json`/`settings.json` ever get a chance to be
read), the old directory was left untouched and the user's WebDAV
configuration silently disappeared from the running tool.

The migration now:

- keeps the atomic `rename` path when only the old directory exists;
- when both directories exist, copies every entry from `old` into `new`
  for which `new` does not already have a same-named counterpart
  (files, nested files, and empty subtrees alike);
- never overwrites a same-named entry in `new` so the new directory
  keeps authoritative state;
- leaves the old directory in place and prints a warning so the user
  can clean it up by hand once they have confirmed everything looks
  right.

A new unit test (`migrate_merges_missing_files_when_both_dirs_exist`)
covers the merged case with overlapping, old-only, new-only, and
nested entries.

## 0.1.19 (2026-08-31)

### Features

#### Rename project from `aimux` to `apmux` with full auto-migration:

- Binary, config dir (`~/.aimux` → `~/.apmux`), env vars (`AIMUX_*` → `APMUX_*`), and WebDAV namespace (`aimux-sync` → `apmux-sync`) all follow the new name. A one-time migration moves existing config on first run; WebDAV data is auto-copied to the new namespace on first sync.
- Data-layer JSON fields stay package-free (no `aimux` strings inside store/webdav/manifest payloads) so future renames don't have to touch user data. The only package-coupled surface is the folder namespace, which is the legitimate place for it.
- Internal identifiers (`Paths.aimux_dir`, etc.) renamed to neutral names (`config_dir`, etc.) to avoid renaming churn in the future.
- `update` accepts legacy `aimux/vX.Y.Z` tags; release assets are published as `apmux-*` with `aimux-*` aliases for installs that haven't yet upgraded, so pre-rename binaries keep receiving updates.
- `name::pkg!()` / `name::envpref!()` are the single source of truth for the package name — everything else is derived by concatenation.

## 0.1.18 (2026-08-30)

### Fixes

- TUI text inputs now handle bracketed paste: a paste arrives as one event and is inserted at the cursor with control characters stripped (multi-line paste keeps newlines in the snippet JSON editor), instead of replaying as a keystroke flood — which on slow terminals made input visibly fall behind and keep replaying after the paste finished. The event loop also drains already-queued input before repainting, so paste floods and held auto-repeat keys redraw in one pass instead of one frame per character.

## 0.1.17 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- `KNOWN_CLAUDE_MODEL_IDS` gains the 5-series tier models (`claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-5`, `claude-fable-5`, `claude-mythos-5`) and the legacy 3.x names (`claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-7-sonnet`) from the CLI's own known-models list, and now deliberately excludes dated snapshot IDs (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` style) — undated aliases always track the current snapshot and work the same as `modelOverrides` keys, while dated IDs go stale.

## 0.1.16 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- Catalog popover multi-select: the Slots and Target-model-id popovers now use checkbox semantics like the rest of the TUI — `Space` toggles the item under the cursor without closing the popover (so several slots can be assigned in one visit), `Enter` commits and closes, `Esc` cancels unchanged. The Target picker shows a `[x]` mark for the space-marked id and commits the mark (not wherever the cursor idled), and the hint bar switches to popover-specific keys while one is open.

## 0.1.15 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- WebDAV `Push` and `Pull` now go through a confirmation popup instead of firing immediately on `p` / `u`. The popup shows the remote URL and the timestamp of the last successful sync (or "never" / "从未" on a first run); press `y` / `Enter` to proceed, `n` / `Esc` to cancel. Mirrors the existing `ConfirmDelete` / `ConfirmRestore` flow and the queue→confirm pattern used for write operations elsewhere.
- WebDAV `GET` now accepts HTTP `206 Partial Content` alongside `200 OK` when reading the remote manifest/store. Some WebDAV servers (notably the one behind `webdav.iamrazo.eu.org` and a few nginx + gzip/brotli frontends) return `206` for a plain full-resource GET and a `Content-Range` covering the whole body; the previous strict `match 200` only path therefore rejected the second `aimux sync push` (first push writes manifest.json → second push reads it and bails on `HTTP 206`). Mirrors cc-switch's `resp.status().is_success()` handling.

## 0.1.14 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- Catalog editor fixes for the Claude slot/target-model columns: the header now shows the translated "Target model id" label instead of the raw `field.model_overrides` key, the slot-assignment and target-model-id popovers are now actually rendered (they previously opened invisibly and swallowed every keypress), and the Slots / Target-model-id grid columns display their current values (slot aliases and the chosen target id) instead of always rendering empty cells.

## 0.1.13 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- The catalog editor now distinguishes actual row deletes from slot-popover unassigns via explicit `pending_dropped_slots` and `deleted_default_to` fields on the editor. Previously the app's status bar fired "row deleted" any time `slot_owner.len()` shrank, which incorrectly fired on popover toggle-off. Deleting the Default row also now surfaces a "Default moved to <id>" status instead of silently reassigning the default to the new tail row.

## 0.1.12 (2026-08-29)

### Fixes

- `CatalogEditor` now rejects sub-1000 values for `context_window` and `max_tokens` (treated as None) so a stray "1" placeholder can't pollute the catalog-wide `min()` that drives `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`. Deleting a row that owned slot bindings surfaces a status-bar message reporting how many slots were cleared, so the user isn't left wondering where sonnet went. The Claude modelOverrides path also documents its last-wins behaviour when two rows map to the same Anthropic target. Doc status banner is updated to "v1 implemented (v0.1.11+, awaiting review)" to match the current state.

## 0.1.11 (2026-08-29)

### Features

- Claude providers now carry a model catalog with `target_model_id`, the Anthropic model ID each row proxies (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`). When the target is in the known-id table extracted from the installed Claude Code, the adapter writes the Anthropic ID into `ANTHROPIC_*_MODEL` and emits a `modelOverrides[target] = <row id>` entry so the proxy id is sent at request time — silences the "unrecognised model" warning for gateway-routed models and lets each slot pick its own real Claude window. `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is set to the min of all non-empty `context_window` values. A new `unknown_model_reactive` quick item toggles `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT=1` for the wait-for-the-API fallback. Store-load migration seeds an empty catalog from `provider.model` and per-slot values; the official "Claude Official" row keeps its strip behavior and is unaffected.

## 0.1.10 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- The speedtest and trial launch land in the TUI: `t` probes the selected provider's endpoint from a background thread and reports latency plus HTTP status in the status bar ("Agate: 478 ms (HTTP 200)", official rows are rejected up front), and `o` hands the terminal over to a real trial run of the selected provider — the screen is restored when it exits with "Trial of Agate finished (exit 0) — live configs untouched". Both keys appear in the key bar and help sheet from the shared hint table; live configs are never touched by either action.

## 0.1.9 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- New `aimux try <PROVIDER> [-- <cli args…>]`: trial-launch a provider without touching live configs. Each app gets a throwaway config directory selected through its official override env (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME / OPENCODE_CONFIG / PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR), the real CLI runs attached to your terminal, and the temp dir is removed when it exits. Official rows report there is nothing to try; exit codes pass through.

## 0.1.8 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- Key hints now come from one table. The status-bar hint, the help sheet, and the dispatcher are all generated from a single per-page key vocabulary (`HINTS` in keymap), so the shown keys can no longer drift from the real handlers — a consistency test locks every row to `map_key`. The Providers/Data/Settings help sheets (en + zh) are rendered from that table with Backups/Sync section groups preserved, replacing six hand-maintained i18n blocks.

## 0.1.7 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- Post-switch restart hints and a new "aimux test <provider>" speedtest. Every CLI reads its config at startup, so switches now say so: the TUI status bar appends "restart to apply" and the CLI prints which app needs restarting (works even without --app). The speedtest probes a provider base_url with a warm-up + timed request (cc-switch-cli approach) and reports latency plus HTTP status; official rows explain there is nothing to probe.

## 0.1.6 (2026-08-26)

### Fixes

- Rework the model-catalog editor layout: column widths now adapt to content (long ids no longer collide with later columns), entering edit mode keeps every cell at a fixed width with a tail window so rows never shift, and the popup widens to fit the grid. A regression test locks the alignment between idle and edited states.

## 0.1.5 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- New "aimux status" command reads each app's live config back (who is actually active, which model, where the key lives) and reconciles it against the store, surfacing drift from hand edits or other tools: states ok / drift / external / native / missing, with --json for scripts.

## 0.1.4 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- The snapshot key (b) now lives exclusively inside the Data page instead of being a global shortcut; the provider list hint and help no longer advertise it.

## 0.1.3 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- Merge the scattered backup and sync surfaces into a single Data page: backups list on top (j/k select, Enter restore, b snapshot), sync status below (e setup, p push, u pull). Both r and s open the page; the list footer hint and contextual help reflect the merged layout.

## 0.1.2 (2026-08-26)

### Fixes

- Polish TUI input carets to match cc-switch-cli: the caret now underlines the character under the cursor instead of inserting an underscore glyph that shifts text, and non-text fields (yes/no cycle fields, readonly rows, kept secrets) no longer render a movable cursor at all — they highlight as accent-colored values instead.

## 0.1.1 (2026-08-26)

### Features

#### Name-first UX: providers are addressed by display name everywhere (CLI, TUI, list output); the generated id is now an internal alias only. Fixed Codex rescue leaving requires_openai_auth rows without the shared auth.json key (switch failed with "api_key must not be empty"), and renaming a provider now moves its live slot table instead of leaving a stale entry.

Self-update now resolves releases through the rate-limit-free releases page first (the GitHub REST API was hitting 403 for anonymous users), degrades gracefully to direct download URLs when the API is unavailable, accepts v0.1.1 / 0.1.1 / aimux/v0.1.1 for --version, and parses slash-prefixed tags correctly.

Snippet editor help text now advertises the actually reliable Ctrl+S shortcut instead of Ctrl+Enter.
